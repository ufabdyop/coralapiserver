Creating the Swagger API Docs
---


Swagger API as a tool for generating are active documentation rest APIs.

At the core of swagger is a file that is essentially a schema for a rest api.  dropwizard-swagger is a tool that allows you to generate that schema file based on annotations in your drop wizard Application.

At the time of this writing, tools for combining swagger drop wizard do not completely solve the problem of creating the swagger API schema file.  Following is a list of problems that I encountered while trying to automatically generate a swagger schema file.

* auto-generated docs not quite accurate: when the swagger tools generate json schema for a function signature such as the following, it should recognize the first parameter to be a document that is sent from the client, and the second parameter to be authentication information.  However it interprets the second parameter to also be a parameter that is sent from the client.
    >>  public GenericResponse createRequest(@Valid Project project, @Auth User user) {
This means that the swagger schema document is up looking like this:

...
    "models": {
        "EnableRequest": {
            "id": "EnableRequest",
            "properties": {
                "item": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "member": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "project": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            }
        },
        "User": {
            "id": "User",
            "properties": {
                "username": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            }
        }
    },
...

When it should look like this:

...
    "models": {
        "EnableRequest": {
            "id": "EnableRequest",
            "properties": {
                "item": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "member": {
                    "type": "string"
                },
                "project": {
                    "type": "string"
                }
            }
        }
...

* swagger version behind: the dropwizard-swagger tool was built to generate swagger schema for version 1.2.  2.0 is the current version.  Fortunately and there is a project can be used to convert Version 1.2 schema documents to version 2.0 (https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-converter). 

To build the Version 2 swagger docs, you have to start the coral API server.  Save the file from http://localhost:4001/api-docs and all the linked paths from api-docs.  As of now, those are:
/v0/enable
/v0/authenticate
/v0/resetPassword
/v0/member
/v0/account
/v0/projects
/v0/whoami
/v0/version
/v0/reservation
/v0/checkKey
/v0/projectMembership
/v0/labRoles
/v0/disable
/v0/machine
Then use swagger-converter to update to v2.0, then manually edit to fix issues mentioned above.  There is a helper node js script in util.
